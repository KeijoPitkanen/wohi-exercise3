    <p>I'm a third year student at UEF studying Information technology. I studied the same subject for two years at Oulu
      Unviersity
      but this summer I came here. So in a way it's also my first year because while changing universities I lost over
      100 credits :(
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My interests include retro video games especially the Disgaea, Final Fantasy and Castlevania series. I also
      sometimes play
      Old School Runescape. Propably the most intresting thing about me is that I'm a blacksmith but unfortunately I
      haven't been able
      to do much forging because my shop is located in Satakunta.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When it comes to computers my points of interests include open source projects, linux, hash algorithms, HCI and
      terminal based programs.
      I started learning programming with C+ when I was 14 but now I would say that java is closest to a native language
      for me. I've also used
      C#, C++, Bash, Kotlin and currently I'm learning some basic COBOL as a fun side projects
